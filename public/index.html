              This sample prompt <i>Intelligent Machines</i> is a representative
              of the prompts from the ACT writing Test
            </p>
            <p>
              The test describes an issue and provides three different
              perspectives on the issue. You are asked to read and consider the
              issue and perspectives, state your own perspective on the issue,
              and analyze the relationship between your perspective and at least
              one other perspective on the issue. Your score will not be
              affected by the perspective you take on the issue.
            </p>

              <b>Intelligent Machines</b>
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center">
              Many of the goods and services we depend on daily are now supplied
              by intelligent, automated machines rather than human beings.
              Robots build cars and other goods on assembly lines, where once
              there were human workers. Many of our phone conversations are now
              conducted not with people but with sophisticated technologies. We
              can now buy goods at a variety of stores without the help of a
              human cashier. Automation is generally seen as a sign of progress,
              but what is lost when we replace humans with machines? Given the
              accelerating variety and prevalence of intelligent machines, it is
              worth examining the implications and meaning of their presence in
              our lives.

                        is some part of our own humanity. Even our mundane daily
                        encounters no longer require from us basic courtesy,

                        work better than humans. This efficiency leads to a more
